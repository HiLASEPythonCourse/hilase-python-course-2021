Numarray had faster operations for \nlarge arrays, but was slower than Numeric on small ones, so for a time both packages\n were used in parallel for different use cases. The last version of Numeric (v24.2)\n  was released on 11 November 2005, while the last version of numarray (v1.5.2)\n  was released on 24 August 2006.\n\n> There was a desire to get Numeric into the Python standard library,\nbut Guido van Rossum decided that the code was not maintainable in its state then.\n\n> In early 2005, NumPy developer Travis Oliphant wanted to unify the community\n around a single array package and ported Numarray's features to Numeric,\n releasing the result as NumPy 1.0 in 2006. This new project was part of SciPy.\n  To avoid installing the large SciPy package just to get an array object\n   this new package was separated and called NumPy.\n    Support for Python 3 was added in 2011 with NumPy version 1.5.0. \n\n> In the early Oughts, the open source scientific computing community was reaching a critical point of maturity for Numeric/Numpy, IPython, Matplotlib, and SciPy. By 2010, a critical mass of projects were in need of a more formal structure to provide support and help to organize the community.\n\n…enter [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/)!\n\n> Travis Oliphant (author of NumPy), Fernando Pérez (author of IPython), Perry Greenfield (author of Numarray and Astropy), John Hunter (author of Matplotlib), Jarrod Millman (release manager for SciPy), and Anthony Scopatz (who came up with the name “NumFOCUS”) became the founding board of NumFOCUS. Leah Silen was selected as the founding Executive Director. In fall of 2012, NumFOCUS received 501(c)(3) public charity status as a nonprofit in the United States. \n\n### Sponsored projects","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-21320701-e8ad-4ae3-b311-b54672dd6b63","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![NumFOCUS-sponsored projects](image-20210118-143459.png)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-5edf219d-36b0-47df-bac9-b7c0233f5b73","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Notable libraries","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-9f05694b-9b44-47af-9c9c-f269172eed08","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Arrays and dataframes\n\n- [**numpy**](https://numpy.org/) (efficient multidimensional arrays)\n- [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (tabular data)\n- [**xarray**](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) (multidimensional arrays + meta-data)\n\n### Mathematics and statistics\n\n- scipy\n- statsmodels\n- sympy (symbolic maths)\n\n### Visualization\n\n- **matplotlib**\n- **plotly** (interactive plots)\n- bokeh\n- seaborn\n- altair\n- vega\n- d3.js\n- hvplot\n- ...many many others\n\n### Image processing\n\n- opencv\n- scikit-image\n- PIL\n\n### Performance\n\n- numba\n- cython\n- jax\n\n### Parallelization\n\n- dask\n- ray\n\n### Big data\n\n- (py)spark\n\n### Machine learning\n\n- scikit-learn\n- tensorflow\n- pytorch\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-0113ae41-66ea-4e04-af73-e0c14372b1c5","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-88932c8b-84a0-4c52-9bf5-522337933f61","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"a86af3d6-d019-46c8-b367-49bd5c6d1cb8","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
