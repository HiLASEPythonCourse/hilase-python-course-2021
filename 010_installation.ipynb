Download the Python 3.8 version of miniconda for your operating system from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.\n2. Follow the \"Regular installation\" instructions in https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation.\n\nOn MacOS, run\n```\nbash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n```\nOn Linux:\n```\nbash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n```\nOn Windows, execute the downloaded `.exe` file.\n\n3. Verify the installation.\n    * If you are unsure about things like environment variables etc., restart your system first.\n    * Open a terminal with conda initialized as described in https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html.\n    * Verify conda installation by running `conda --version`.\n\n4. Create a dedicated virtual environment:\n```\nconda create -n python-course-2021 -c conda-forge python=3.8\n```\n5. Activate this new environment:\n```\nconda activate python-course-2021\n```\n6. Install required packages (always do this after activating the correct conda environment):\n```\nconda install numpy scipy matplotlib plotly pandas sphinx black pytest flake8 sqlalchemy xarray pep8-naming openpyxl lxml jupyter ipython\n```\n\n## Alternative: System Python in Ubuntu\n\nIf you are using a recent version of Ubuntu (say 20.04 LTS), you should have a recommended version of Python (3.8)\nalready installed on your system. In such case, just make sure you have the `python3.8-venv` and `python3.8-pip`\npackages installed as well. You will need to work in a \"virtual environment\" to install the necessary libraries.\n\nIn a directory of your choice, run the following:\n\n```\npython3.8 -m venv ./python-course-venv       # Create the environment (once)\nsource ./python-course-venv/bin/activate     # Use the environment (every time)\n```\n\n(Note that we are using Python 3.8, the newest, non-default version 3.9 is not friendly with all the scientific libraries as of December 2020).\n\nThen you can install the required libraries:\n\n```\npip install wheel\npip install numpy scipy matplotlib plotly pandas sphinx black pytest flake8 sqlalchemy xarray pep8-naming openpyxl lxml jupyter ipython\n```\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-b63b255e-7d57-4ec4-b3ef-f8d64087c965","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Verify the installation\n\nPlease check that your local installation works by starting an ipython interactive session \n(do not forget to **activate the environment first** as described above):\n```\nipython\n```\nYou should see something like\n```\nPython 3.8.6 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 27 2020, 19:17:44)\nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\nIPython 7.19.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\n\nIn [1]:\n```\nTry to run (maybe your first) Python minicode:\n```\nIn [1]: import numpy\n\nIn [2]: print(f\"My numpy version is {numpy.version.full_version}\")\nMy numpy version is 1.19.4\n```\n(The numpy version can differ in case a newer version has been released since Dec 2020.)\n\n\n## On-line alternative\n\n**(In preparation)** We will use an on-line environment for presenting the code that you can observe, comment and even step in.\nIn extreme cases, you will even be able to live without local Python installation though it definitely is not recommended.\nMore details will follow.\n\n## Further alternatives? Rather not.\n\nWe believe that basically any installation of relatively new Python (version 3.7 or higher) is capable of installing the requested\nlibraries and running the code we will show during the course but... the small \"but\" is in that there may be small glitches or inconsistencies\nthat would typically occur during the lecture when the time should be devoted to other topics. We simply cannot give support and you are on your own.\n*(Please, let us know if you really really must work in an environment different from the abovementioned alternatives.)*\n\n## Jupyter Notebooks\n\nWe will use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook environment, which is a web-based application that allows to run Python code\nand combine it seamlesly with graphical output and user interaction. Notebooks thus enable creating and working with live documents.\n\nPlease try to start Jupyter Notebook server as described in https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html.\nPlay a little bit around with the [Notebook Basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html).\n\n## Recommended development environments / editors\n\nA capable, Python-aware editor or integrated development environment (IDE) becomes indispensable\nonce you start with a more \"serious\" development: larger projects, shared packages etc.\nWe have short-listed community and personally proven possibilities.\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nThis is a general, multi-purpose and very capable free editor, not just for Python.\n\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/\n\n### PyCharm\n\nThis is a heavy-weight, full IDE dedicated to Python, probably the most powerful one. Although there is a Professional version,\nin scientific computing, with the Community edition you will be just fine.\n\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\n\n## Notepad++, vim, emacs, ...\n\nMany editors have at least some basic syntax highlighting for Python, so don't be afraid to use your favourite one.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-3b188233-b762-4326-9e24-ebc4f31d13a8","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-328aa1d7-83e3-491b-b839-221655ea1109","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"27956968-536f-4922-978f-6bc5e0fd4cb7","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
