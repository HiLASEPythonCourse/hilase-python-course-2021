There are multiple levels of rigorousness (and religiosity)\nwhen it comes to testing:\n\n- never: this is valid strategy for one-time scripts\n- test the basic features as you use them to catch the biggest bugs (you can start with one or two integration/functional tests with your typical scenarios\n and when you break something, it will *probably* fail early)\n- write tests that capture a certain bug and make sure that it won't appear again (while you are debugging,\n  you may as well copy the code you execute and make it an automatic test)\n- 100-% (or some other percentage) code coverage - you make sure that (almost) each line of your code gets executed at least once in the tests and you  will spot\na lot of bugs early. Reaching 100-% level does not assure your code is bug-free and focusing on this single metric can be dangerous.\n- test-driven development - a nice (though rarely applied) concept of first writing the tests (that will fail initially) and then the code itself (make it pass).\n\nNote that especially with the code used by others, it is important not just to test what happens with an expected and correct input (you probably code against this model)\nbut maybe even more important is to check what happens with unexpected input.\n\nAlso note that a properly written is a good form of documentation - a test can be an example how to use your functions / libraries.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-3bad0b0c-6b09-4bdc-b06c-5d4dfe9e0b93","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Assertions\n\nThis is a nice tool in the process of development - at certain point of the code you may make sure that you assumptions are correct by writing a simple yes/no test\ncalled \"assertion\" (one line = one boolean condition).\n\nWhen this line is executed, either the assumption holds (and nothing happens) or it fails (and an `AssertionError` is thrown).","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-9cf99575-750a-414a-8147-2130adc07b3e","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00004-a1b15271-a72c-4045-a871-1ffd291b9b89","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"600f8c8f","execution_start":1612175867368,"execution_millis":2,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"assert 14 > 10\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The assumption is correct, so nothing (visible) happens.\n\nBut let's make another (admittedly stupid) assumption:","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-68acee37-97f0-4732-a02d-3653d4a42cca","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-20919a25-c95f-40ba-ae1e-98a40dc16abc","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"d84a217b","execution_start":1612175880275,"execution_millis":721,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"assert 14 < 10","execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"AssertionError","evalue":"","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mAssertionError\u001b[0m                            Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-25-8510ed953d36>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32massert\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m14\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m<\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m10\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mAssertionError\u001b[0m: "]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code fails with an exception.
