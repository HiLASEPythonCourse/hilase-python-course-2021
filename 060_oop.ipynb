They allow you to step into the process of reading or setting attributes.\nIt is useful, for example, if an object has several interdependent parameters, and we do not want to store them independently;\nor if we want to check what value is stored; or if we want to do anything interesting with the values.\nProperties are also handy for lazy evaluation - i.e. for postponing some operation (calculation, resource access etc.)\nto the point when it is actually needed.\n\nFrom the syntactic point of view, we must first define the method that bears the name of the property and that \"reads\" the property (returns its value).\nThe line above must include a **`property`** *decorator* \n(for details see e.g. [Primer on Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)). \nIf we want, we can then create methods for writing and deleting.\n\nOnce we have created the following properties, we approach them as common data attributes - call them without brackets and assign to them using the sign \"equals\".\n\nProperties work like properties in C# or Java JavaBeans. However, notice that for accessing properties exactly the same notation as for accessing data\nattributes is used. Hence if someone wants to change the behavior of a data attribute and make it a property,\nclients of the class will not recognize it and will not have to make any changes in the code.\nIt is therefore not necessary and even advisalble to pro-actively create trivial properties that encapsulate only access to attributes\n(like we would certainly do in Java).\n\nWe will show how properties

Two underscores at the beginning of the name of an attribute renames it so it's really hard to reference the attribute outside the context of the class.\nGenerally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.\n3. Attributes with two undescores at the beginning and at the end have a special meaning (see [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names)). \nWe have already seen __init__  and will look at several others.\n    * `__repr__` and `__str__` convert the object to a string.\n    * `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` are used for reading and storing not found attributes.\n    * `__call__` will be called when we use the object as a function.\n    * `__doc__` contains documentation (docstring).\n    * `__dict__` contains the dictionary with the namespace of the object.\n    * ...
